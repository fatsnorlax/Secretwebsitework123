                  amount of bonus points that is given in the description of the
                  Inventory in the Personal Account; these bonus points give a
                  discount when paying a license fee for the game Crash
                  participation, with one bonus point equals to one rouble
                  exclusively for these purposes (payment of license fees)
                </li>
                <li>
                  The parties agreed that these bonus points are not cash and
                  are not refundable and/or exchangeable
                </li>
                <li>
                  To sell the Inventory, the User within 1 (one) year from the
                  moment of receiving the Inventory follows the corresponding
                  link located in the Personal Account section next to a
                  description of this Inventory
                </li>
                <li>
                  Inactivity of the User during that year means sale of his/her
                  Inventory, which has been received by User, but not claimed
                  and moved to Steam account.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When the Inventory is alienated, the bonus points received by
                  the User are displayed in the Personal Account
                </li>
                <li>
                  Owner does not provide cash refunds from the account, user can
                  only receive refund as an inventory in the Steam account they
                  registered with, in case no rule has been violated from the
                  clauses of this agreement and internal company directives
                </li>
                <li>
                  Withdrawal limit depends on the transaction history of the
                  particular user on the cs.fail website and is considered
                  individually in each case. Every user will undergo an internal
                  check by Owner to confirm compliance with the terms of this
                  agreement before withdrawal. In case of successful
                  verification, Owner will enable User to make a withdrawal. The
                  fact of a successful check on one withdrawal does not give
                  User an automatic confirmation of the legality of the next
                  requested withdrawal, each conclusion passes an individual
                  check. Owner reserves the right to block subsequent
                  withdrawals and User’s account itself in case of violation of
                  the clauses of this agreement, regardless of time/date
